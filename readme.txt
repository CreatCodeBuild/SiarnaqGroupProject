To run the programs:

	

	To start Sixes Wild, go to the src folder, the sixesWildBoundary package, and run SplashScreen.java as a java application.

	To start Level Builder, go to the src folder, the levelBuilderBoundary
 package, and run SplashScreen.java as a java application






Sixes Wild:
	As you complete levels, new ones will unlock.  If you exit the application using
 the quit game button on the main menu, your level progress will be saved and will
	be automatically accessed when you re-run the application.  To reset your progress,
 press the reset progress button on the main menu.






Level Builder:
	When entering values, press enter to save them. For all release levels, the remove
 special move will not be enabled regardless of the selection made in the level 
builder.  For the generate level and priview buttons to be enabled, you must enter a level
number, either max moves or max time, and for release,  enter a percentage for tile values.




**NOTE: 12 levels are included.  To make new levels, select new level in the level builder drop
down combo box.  Then add the next level number (13 for your first level) and choose the level type.
In order to match what we have been doing make the following levels: Puzzle 13, Lightning 14, Elimination 15, Release 16





***NOTE: 6s will always appear at the top for release mode
